*__June 26th Cohort__*

### CapStone 1
* Deep Quartet

See my blog post [here](https://kkonz.github.io/2017-12-02-deep-quartet/), where I demonstrate how I obtain midi files for training a stacked LSTM deep neural network with reharmonizing and resampling with psuedo-Gibbs sampling. I added additional string quartets as well as sampled from Kashmir and Going to California from Led Zeppelin.

### CapStone 2
* Pizza2Vec
See my blog post [here](https://kkonz.github.io/2017-12-10-topic-modeling-with-yelp-pizza2vec/), where I process the yelp data to create tokenized and lemmitzed representations of the yelp reviews. Additionally the words are formed into bi, and trigram representations such as ny_style_pizza. I fit the words into bag of words representation and use a latent direlecht allocation model to find term frequencies. I also normalize the data by choosing the TopN words and remove stop words. I then fit a word2vec model for all reviews. I preform t-sne dimension reduction and cluster with Spectral Clustering, nearest neighbors affinity with kmeans labels.
