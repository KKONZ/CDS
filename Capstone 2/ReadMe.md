## Pizza2Vec

### Topic modeling with Yelp

This is the repo that built the blog posting for the Springboard Capstone 2. This provides details how to read the data from the json format and write to text files.
It also provides code for preprocessing the data. In this we tokenize the words, lemmatize the words, create a continuous bag of words representation, word2vec, lda topic frequencies, t-sne reduction, and spectral clustering.

__Shout out to Patrick Harrison, his tutorial at pycon was a foundation for this project.__
A [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zm9NC9uRkk) video from that session is in the link. I have forked the original ipynb which can be found [here](https://github.com/KKONZ/modern-nlp-in-python/blob/master/executable/Modern_NLP_in_Python.ipynb) note that version uses python2. I have updated all of the print calls and what not so that the code can be executed in python 3 in this ipyb, pizza2vec.ipynb.
