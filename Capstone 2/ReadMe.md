## Pizza2Vec

### Topic modeling with Yelp

This is the repo that built the blog posting for the Springboard Capstone 2. This provides details how to read the data from the json format and write to text files.
It also provides code for preprocessing the data. In this we tokenize the words, lemmatize the words, create a continuous bag of words representation, word2vec, lda topic frequencies, t-sne reduction, and spectral clustering.

__Shout out to Patrick Harrison, his tutorial at pycon was a foundation for this project.__
