    "3) The dataset is string quartets scrapped using the Python handle for Selenium. The entire files are trainable, but ideally I would like to find a solution to chop up each of the files into small sections. This approach seemed to reduce the noise and created more compelling output than with the full files. I first hand cleaned about 100 files by hand, then used Music21 to chop up the files but was running into bugs. I fixed one of the main bugs and pushed to the main repo for the translate module in the midi class, but there are still issues with note durations created by the package. \n",
    "\n",
    "I also reached out to Ole who maintains the Mido Python package for working with midi data. He stated his package was probaby too low level and that I may have more sucess with the Pretty-Midi package.\n",
    "I am nervous about meta data with key, time, and voice assignments when chopping up files though. At least for now will use full files as the model output is still very compelling."

    "5) Initial findings are incredibly exciting. It was a bit of a gamble to try a modeling technique designed for chorus and generalize the technique to strings. \n",
    "One concern I had was that a single voice, say a violin, could be polyphonic in that it has much more chords per voice then in a chorus. However this did not appear to be an issue."
